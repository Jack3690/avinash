title: "About me"
excerpt: >
  I am a PhD student at Instituto Nacional de Astrofísica, Óptica y Electrónica, Puebla, Mexico. I work in the domain of Extragalactic star formation and galaxy     evolution. My PhD research aims to study superbubbles which are large voids in the interstellar medium of galaxies believed to be a consequence of stellar feedback processes such as winds and supernovae. To understand the energetics of the feedback process, I study the stellar populations responsible for creating the superbubbles using multi-wavelength data. I am currently utilizing data from the James Webb Space Telescope Near InfraRed Camera (JWST-NIRCAM) to study resolved stellar populations inside large bubbles in NGC 628 (M74). NGC 628 is a late-type face-on spiral galaxy at a distance of 8.87 Mpcs.
